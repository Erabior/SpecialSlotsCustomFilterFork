# Special Slots

### WHAT
As of version 0.12.12.30.19078, BSG gave us 3 "SPEC" slots. My question is, "Why not allow us to put other items in one of those slots?"

Well, here you go.

Special Slots now hold all.

### Pros/Cons

Pros:
  * Special Slots can hold anything.
  * Special Slots can be used to hold containers so you can hold even more items.
  * Special Slots retain everything after death. (See 'Cons' section for the one exception.)

Cons:
  * Special Slots cannot hold stacks of objects such as Ammo unless they are in a container.
  * Special Slots use containers much like the Armor, Backpack, and Secure Container slots so the containers expand when placed in the slots.
  * Containers/Weapons/Items placed into Special Slots that have been insured will go through the insurance process upon your death. For example: if you have an insured container full of awesome loot in a Special Slot when you die, then you loose the loot and the container is subject to the insurance process.

### Good Luck Soldier!
